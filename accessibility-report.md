**QUESTION 1:
 For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:
(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or
(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.**

Principle 1: Equitable Use
UniSpend is intended to be for university/college stunted in North America however, the app is designed to be inclusive and accessible to users regardless of their financial situation and age. Thus, enabling everyone to effectively track and manage their finances by customizing budget categories and spending goals to suit their unique needs. It accommodates visually impaired users through the use of large buttons, bold text, and color-coded elements with high contrast, ensuring ease of use and readability for all, including those with visual impairments.

Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
The program accommodates a wide range of user preferences by allowing users to customize budget categories and set personalized spending goals, ensuring the app adapts to different financial situations, regardless of whether the user is a low or high income earner. Additionally, it includes features like multilingual support, with chatbot translations available in English and French, making the app accessible to users in the two most spoken languages in Canada. 

Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
The interface is very intuitive and simple for all users, with each page having very few buttons that are color-coded and consist of large, clearly labeled text. This helps users easily distinguish the functionality of each button. The design ensures the app is self-explanatory, even for first-time users, and avoids unnecessary complexity, making navigation straightforward.

Principle 4: Perceptible Information
The app effectively conveys information through color-coded visual charts that are simple and easy to understand, which are paired with text descriptions explaining each part of the chart, ensuring accessibility for users with visual impairments, including those who are colorblind. Additionally, our chatbot supports translation into French, enabling the app to serve users in the two most spoken languages in Canada. To further enhance accessibility, we could implement a colorblind mode and a text-to-speech feature for users with more significant visual impairments. 

Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
The app currently provides slight tolerance for error, as it allows users to re-input their data if a mistake is made. However, depending on which specific data is being re-inputted, this may cause certain previous inputs stored in the database to be deleted, requiring users to re-enter those inputs, which can be tedious and repetitive. To improve this, a feature could be introduced that allows users to undo a single input and replace it without affecting previous entries, significantly reducing the effort required to correct errors and creating a smoother user experience.

Principle 6: Low physical Effort
The app minimizes user effort by requiring only input from the user, with the application automatically generating colorful charts that neatly display the data, thus reducing physical and cognitive workload by automating data visualization. The buttons are large, with clear, bold text and feature contrasting colors between the button text and background, ensuring there is no eye strain or need for users to focus hard to click a specific button, further reducing the physical effort required. Furthermore, if the user has already entered specific inputs, the database stores these inputs ensuring no repetitive inputs are needed.

Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
This principle does not apply to our program as it focuses on the physical accessibility for approach, reach and manipulation in physical environments based on user’s body size, posture or mobility.

**QUESTION 2:**
**Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.**

UniSpend would be marketed primarily towards college and university students, particularly those living in North American metropolitan cities with a higher cost of living. Our Budget Maker feature which creates a breakdown of how students should spend their income was trained using research data from recommended financial advice for students in Toronto which means it caters specific advice for students in metropolitan cities such as Toronto. The app is tailored to provide financial advice for the needs of students who are balancing a limited income (below the average income of a person working a full time job) with the high costs of rent, groceries and other living expenses. The app would especially appeal to international students who may need additional guidance in navigating a new financial system and understanding local costs. While the app specifically caters to university students, this should not discourage others interested in improving their financial skills from using UniSpend.

**QUESTION 3:**
**Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.**

Our program may be less likely to be used by demographics who have limited access to the internet, such as those living in rural areas with poor connectivity. This is due to our program needing to maintain internet connectivity at all times to connect to our remote database. Additionally, while the app supports English and French (for the ChatBot), it may not be as accessible to users who primarily speak other languages or have limited proficiency in either. Visually impaired users who rely on assistive technologies like screen readers may also find it challenging to use certain features until planned improvements, like text-to-speech and colorblind modes, are implemented. Finally, at its current state, UniSpend specifically caters towards university students due to the way our BudgetMaker has been trained on research data for university students. . As a result, non-university students such as older adults may find that our BudgetMaker does not provide them with an optimal budget to fit their needs, leading to a reduction in users of older ages.
